# Simple-Cloud-Storage-Python-Flask-App-Local-Development

This repo uses Python and Flask to create a simple web app that allows you to upload and delete files using an ultra-simple UI leveraging Google Cloud Storage. Running this app locally allows us to use application default credentials to authenticate the application in order to leverage Google Cloud storage APIs.
